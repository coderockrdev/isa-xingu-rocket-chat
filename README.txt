Rocket.Chat Module for Drupal 8.

1/ Overview:

rocket_chat is a Drupal 8 Module which offer you the ability to communicate with
 your website guests.
This Module has been tested on a local server with the default http protocol and
 default 3000 port, and still under development.

You could just bring the embed javascript code and install a livechat widget in
your Drupal website with less time than
having a module. Why all this? Because installing a widget that way is simple,
no features, nothing, just the already
built-in widget with normal behaviour, what if you want to use some features
with the widget? That's what the module for.
Please request for more code and quality enhancement

server address and port, then:

  then clear cache (one more time)
